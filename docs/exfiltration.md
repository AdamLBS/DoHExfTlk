# Exfiltration System Documentation

## üéØ Overview

The DoH Exfiltration System is the core component responsible for data exfiltration via DNS-over-HTTPS and its capture/reconstruction. It consists of a sophisticated client for data transmission and an intelligent server for capturing and reconstructing exfiltrated data.

## üñ•Ô∏è Server Architecture and Operation

### Data Capture Mechanism

The exfiltration server operates as a real-time traffic interceptor that monitors DNS queries to capture exfiltration data. It runs in host network mode with elevated privileges to capture network traffic directly from the DNS resolver.

**Core Capture Process:**
1. **Traffic Monitoring**: Continuously captures DNS queries from the resolver container
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Analyzes domain names for exfiltration data patterns
3. **Chunk Identification**: Recognizes structured data patterns in subdomains
4. **Session Tracking**: Groups related chunks into exfiltration sessions
5. **Data Reconstruction**: Assembles chunks back into original files

### Pattern Analysis

The server uses sophisticated pattern matching to identify and capture exfiltration data:

**Chunk Pattern Recognition:**
- Recognizes structured patterns in DNS queries containing data
- Identifies session IDs, chunk numbers, and total chunk counts
- Determines encoding schemes used for data transmission
- Tracks timing patterns and query frequencies

**Domain Analysis:**
- Monitors for exfiltration domain patterns
- Recognizes domain rotation techniques
- Identifies randomized subdomain schemes
- Tracks backup domain usage

### Session Management

Each exfiltration session is tracked independently:

**Session Tracking:**
- Unique session identifiers for each file transmission
- Timeout mechanisms for incomplete sessions
- Chunk ordering and verification
- Missing chunk detection and handling

**Data Assembly:**
- Real-time chunk collection and ordering
- Automatic encoding detection and decoding
- Data integrity verification
- File type identification using magic bytes

## üì± Client Architecture and Operation

### Configuration System

The client uses a flexible JSON-based configuration system that allows for sophisticated exfiltration scenarios:

**Configuration Management:**
- Interactive configuration generation
- Template-based scenario creation
- Parameter validation and testing
- Runtime configuration loading

**Scenario Types:**
- **APT Simulation**: Slow, stealthy exfiltration with advanced evasion
- **Speed Benchmark**: Maximum throughput testing
- **Stealth Research**: Advanced evasion technique testing
- **Quick Test**: Basic functionality validation

### Data Processing Pipeline

The client follows a multi-stage process for data exfiltration:

**Data Preparation:**
1. **File Reading**: Loads target files for exfiltration
2. **Compression**: Optional data compression for efficiency
3. **Encryption**: Optional encryption for data protection
4. **Chunking**: Splits data into transmittable segments
5. **Encoding**: Applies encoding schemes (Base64, Base32, Hex, Custom)

**Transmission Process:**
1. **Session Initialization**: Creates unique session identifier
2. **Chunk Transmission**: Sends chunks via DNS queries
3. **Timing Control**: Implements sophisticated timing patterns
4. **Domain Rotation**: Uses multiple domains for evasion
5. **Error Handling**: Manages retries and failures

### Evasion Techniques

The client implements multiple sophisticated evasion techniques:

**Timing Evasion:**
- **Regular Patterns**: Fixed intervals for baseline testing
- **Random Timing**: Variable delays with statistical distribution
- **Burst Mode**: Rapid transmission followed by long pauses
- **Stealth Mode**: Adaptive timing to mimic legitimate traffic

**Domain Evasion:**
- **Domain Rotation**: Cycles through multiple target domains
- **Subdomain Randomization**: Random subdomain generation
- **Backup Domains**: Fallback domains for resilience
- **Legitimate-Looking Domains**: Mimics real service domains

**Data Evasion:**
- **Compression**: Reduces data footprint
- **Encryption**: Obfuscates data content
- **Padding**: Adds noise to confuse detection
- **Custom Encoding**: Non-standard encoding schemes

## üóÇÔ∏è File Recovery and Access

### Captured Files Location

Successfully captured and reconstructed files are stored in the server's capture directory:

**File Organization:**
- Each session creates a separate reconstructed file
- Files are named using session identifiers and timestamps
- Original file extensions are preserved when detectable
- Metadata files accompany each reconstructed file

**Access Methods:**
- Direct file system access within the server container
- Docker volume mounts for host system access
- Export capabilities for analysis tools
- Automated cleanup and archival options

### File Reconstruction Process

The server employs intelligent reconstruction techniques:

**Chunk Assembly:**
1. **Collection**: Gathers all chunks belonging to a session
2. **Ordering**: Sorts chunks by sequence number
3. **Validation**: Verifies chunk integrity and completeness
4. **Decoding**: Applies appropriate decoding schemes
5. **Assembly**: Reconstructs original file content

**Data Validation:**
- Checksum verification for data integrity
- Missing chunk detection and reporting
- Duplicate chunk handling
- Corruption detection and recovery

## üîç Magic Bytes and File Type Detection

### Magic Byte Analysis

The system uses magic bytes for intelligent file type identification:

**Detection Capabilities:**
- **Document Files**: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint documents
- **Image Files**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF formats
- **Archive Files**: ZIP, RAR, 7Z, TAR archives
- **Executable Files**: PE, ELF, Mach-O executables
- **Media Files**: MP3, MP4, AVI, MOV multimedia
- **Text Files**: Plain text, CSV, JSON, XML data

**Implementation Benefits:**
- Automatic file extension assignment

### File Type Processing
